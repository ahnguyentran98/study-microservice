# AWS Migration Guide - ECS + Fargate
## From Local Docker to AWS Cloud

### ðŸŽ¯ Architecture Comparison

| Component | Local Docker | AWS Replacement |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **API Gateway** | Spring Cloud Gateway | Application Load Balancer (ALB) |
| **Service Discovery** | Container names | AWS Service Discovery |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL container | RDS PostgreSQL |
| **Caching** | Redis container | ElastiCache Redis |
| **Message Queue** | RabbitMQ container | Amazon MQ |
| **Microservices** | Docker containers | ECS Fargate tasks |
| **Frontend** | Vue.js container | S3 + CloudFront |
| **Monitoring** | Docker logs | CloudWatch |
| **Load Balancing** | None | Application Load Balancer |
| **Networking** | Docker bridge | VPC with subnets |

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Flow

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
**Goal**: Replace local infrastructure with AWS managed services

**Steps**:
1. Create ECR repositories for container images
2. Setup RDS PostgreSQL (replaces PostgreSQL container)
3. Setup ElastiCache Redis (replaces Redis container)
4. Create ECS Fargate cluster (replaces Docker engine)
5. Configure VPC and security groups (replaces Docker network)

### Phase 2: Service Migration (Week 2)
**Goal**: Move microservices from local containers to ECS

**Steps**:
1. Build and push images to ECR
2. Create ECS task definitions for each service
3. Deploy services to ECS Fargate
4. Configure service-to-service communication via Service Discovery

### Phase 3: Load Balancing & Networking (Week 3)
**Goal**: Replace API Gateway with AWS Load Balancer

**Steps**:
1. Create Application Load Balancer (replaces Spring Cloud Gateway)
2. Configure target groups for each service
3. Setup routing rules (replaces gateway routing)
4. Configure health checks

### Phase 4: Frontend & Monitoring (Week 4)
**Goal**: Deploy frontend and setup monitoring

**Steps**:
1. Deploy Vue.js frontend to S3 + CloudFront
2. Setup CloudWatch logging (replaces Docker logs)
3. Configure monitoring dashboards
4. Test end-to-end functionality

## ðŸ”„ Service Communication Changes

### Local Development
```
Frontend â†’ API Gateway â†’ Service A â†’ Service B
```

### AWS Cloud
```
Frontend (S3) â†’ ALB â†’ ECS Service A â†’ ECS Service B
```

**Key Changes**:
- **Service URLs**: `http://service-name:8080` â†’ `http://service-name.microservices.local:8080`
- **Database URLs**: `postgres:5432` â†’ `microservices-postgres.region.rds.amazonaws.com:5432`
- **Cache URLs**: `redis:6379` â†’ `microservices-redis.cache.amazonaws.com:6379`

## ðŸ’° Cost Comparison

| Component | Local Cost | AWS Cost/Month |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Compute** | $0 | $40-60 (ECS Fargate) |
| **Database** | $0 | $15-25 (RDS) |
| **Cache** | $0 | $15-20 (ElastiCache) |
| **Load Balancer** | $0 | $20 (ALB) |
| **Storage** | $0 | $5-10 (S3, ECR) |
| **Total** | **$0** | **$95-135** |

## ðŸš€ Deployment Process

### Local Development
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### AWS Deployment
```bash
# 1. Build and push images
docker build & docker push to ECR

# 2. Update ECS services
aws ecs update-service --force-new-deployment

# 3. Monitor deployment
aws ecs wait services-stable
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits After Migration

### What You Gain:
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on demand
- **Reliability**: Managed services with high availability
- **Security**: IAM roles, security groups, encryption
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- **Backup**: Automated RDS backups

### What You Lose:
- **Cost**: Monthly cloud bills
- **Control**: Less direct control over infrastructure
- **Simplicity**: More complex deployment process

## ðŸ”§ Migration Timeline

**Week 1**: Infrastructure â†’ Replace containers with managed services
**Week 2**: Services â†’ Move microservices to ECS
**Week 3**: Networking â†’ Replace API Gateway with ALB
**Week 4**: Frontend â†’ Deploy to S3/CloudFront

**Total Time**: 4 weeks part-time
**Total Cost**: ~$100/month ongoing
